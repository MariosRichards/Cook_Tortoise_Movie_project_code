Primary issues
==============

* contact the-numbers.com














Dataset Explorers
=================

- https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ 
- https://dataverse.harvard.edu/ (mostly academic)
- kaggle datasets (lot overlap with dataworld)
- https://data.world/ (we have a list registered in the site)


Fun Secondary Projects
======================

* infer common certification factor
    (perhaps use order?)
    
* inflation adjust/convert all budget/gross to common currency
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_films_adjusted_for_inflation

* try to get "bankability" index for actors/crew -> base on the-numbers.com approach

* gender column with floats to denote probability of "correctly" assigned gender

* any option for trying to remove inflation from gross/budget/profit?

* try to infer ethnicity based on name!!! (mucho discomfort)

-> doesn't work!


pip install git+https://github.com/appeler/ethnicolr.git --no-deps --no-cache-dir
conda install Keras==2.2.4 h5py==2.9.0
h5py==2.9.0

Still problems
https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/2087
install libpython fixes

... still v slow


TWO ISSUES
-> getting it to either use my old AMD card (via opencl/plaidml/coriander) or using CPU
-> getting it to use my old CPU (no AVX)
